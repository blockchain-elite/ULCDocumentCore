ULCDocMod
=========

Summary
-------

The aim of the *ULCDocMod* smart contract is to be an authority that certifies *ULCDocKernel* address.
It has to guarantee the integrity of organisation's *ULCDocKernel* code and the identity of the owner. We can slightly compare it to a *Certificate Authority* for https protocol.

As everyone can publish a *ULCDocMod* smart contract, the acknowledgement is only based on the trust the user give. For example, Blockchain-Elite, the developper of ULCDocuments, publishes it's own ULCDocMod smart contract.
