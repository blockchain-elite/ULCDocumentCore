ULCDocKernel
############

Summary
=======

Each organisation or individual has to publish its own **ULCDocKernel** smart contract. The kernel is used to explicitly publish signatures to the blockchain.
This way, the owner of the published ULCDocKernel smart contract has a complete and independent way to certify documents.

The kernel has 3 main features :

* Multi-Owner ability
* Native timestamp tracking
* *Undestroyable* signatures
