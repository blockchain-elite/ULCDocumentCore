Summary
=======

Each organisation or individual has to publish his own **ULCDocKernel** smart contract. The kernel part is used to explicitly publish signatures to blockchain.
So, the owner of ULCDocKernel has a complete and independent way to certify documents.

The kernel has different features :

* Multi-Owner ability
* Native timestamp tracking
* *Undestroyable* signatures
